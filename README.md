## Getting Started ()

**We recommend using Bun for optimal performance and development experience.** Here's how to get started:

1. **Install Bun:**
   Follow the official Bun installation instructions for your operating system: [https://bun.sh/docs/installation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/autofloww.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd autofloww
   bun install
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` File:**

   Copy the contents of `.env.example` to a new file named `.env.local` and replace the placeholder values with your actual environment variable settings. **Important:** Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control.

   Refer to the `.env.example` file for detailed instructions on each environment variable.

**(Optional: Using Another Package Manager)**

If you prefer using a different package manager like npm or yarn, you can install dependencies with the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

However, Bun's built-in package manager offers efficient installation and management of dependencies.

   ```

2. Access your application at http://localhost:3000 (or the URL specified in `.env.local`).

**Option 2: Vercel Deployment**

1. Configure your deployment environment with the required environment variables.
2. Follow the deployment instructions specific to your chosen platform (Vercel or Netlify).
